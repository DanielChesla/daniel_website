A little about who I am...

In 1983 I got my first computer.  It was a TRS-80 color computer 2, affectionately known as the coco-2.  In 1993 I graduated high school, and had to make decisions about my future.  Originally I decided to start college, but that path seemed too long for an impatient 18 year old 

I eventually landed a job at the local tech company (AKA RadioShack) and soaked up as much knowledge as I could.  I took every course they offered, and eventually realized that the cert path was the way to go.  So I got my A+ and Net+ from compTia.

Then there was the dot.com boom. Everyone scrambled to learn as much as they could.  I went back to school and became one of the first to get an MCSE in NT4.0 and Windows 2000
    
I worked for a few years in the Microsoft admin world.  Then I decided to pursue the networking side, and got my Cisco CCNA.  Eventually I found myself in the world of software development, specifically on the QA realm.  As I learned more about testing and breaking software, I wanted to learn more about code. 

Now, at nearly 50 years old I am back in school.  Why?  To never stop learning
