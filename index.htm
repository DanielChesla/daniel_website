A little about who I am...<br />
<br />

In 1983 I got my first computer.  It was a TRS-80 color computer 2, affectionately known as the coco-2.  Simple computer for simple times, no hard drive, no disk drive, no mouse... just learning to program in BASIC.<br /><br />
    
In 1993 I graduated high school, and had to make decisions about my future.  Originally I decided to start college, but that path seemed too long for an impatient 18 year old.<br /> <br />

I eventually landed a job at the local tech company (AKA RadioShack) and soaked up as much knowledge as I could.  I took every course they offered, and eventually realized that the cert path was the way to go.  So I got my A+ and Net+ from compTia.<br /><br />

Then there was the dot.com boom. Felt like the whole world was scrambling to keep up with the ever changing technology.  I went back to school and became one of the first to get an MCSE in NT4.0 and Windows 2000.<br /><br />
    
I worked for a few years in the Microsoft admin world.  Then I decided to pursue the networking side, and got my Cisco CCNA.<br />  <br />
    
Eventually I found myself in the world of software development, specifically on the QA realm.  As I learned more about testing and breaking software, I wanted to take a deeper dive and formally learn even more about coding. <br /><br />

Now, at nearly 50 years old I am back in school.  Why?  To never stop learning.
